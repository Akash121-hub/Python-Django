'''                     __init__
The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.'''

    def __init__(self, something):
